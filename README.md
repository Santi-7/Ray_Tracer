Ray_Tracer
=============
A simple ray tracer using Phong's BRDF and no extra libraries.

Characteristics
------------
The binary `ray_trace` is used as a showcase of some hardcoded scenes. It can handle the following 3D shapes:

* Spheres
* Planes
* Rectangles
* Triangles
* Boxes
* Triangle meshes (loaded from a cutdown version of .obj files)
* Menger Sponges (just for fun)

It can render Lambertian, mirror and refractive surfaces.

As of `v 1.0` there is no support for bitmap textures but to give scenes some artistic sense you can use checker board patterns of any colors and use some experimental features that mess around with surface normals.

Compilation
-------------
To use the basic binary included to render some samples just run from the project directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Usage
-------------
Usage for the binary is as follows.
```
$ ray_trace -h
Usage: ray_trace [OPTION]...
If no options are specified, a default Cornell box with 64 indirect rays will be rendered and saved as cornell.ppm.

Some images will not look good by default, in such cases use --gamma, to use a gamma correction of 2.2, or --clamp to limit color values to the maximum.

Available options:
	-h : Print this helpful text.
	--res <WIDTHxHEIGHT> : Select a different resolution for the result image.
	--indirect_steps <NUMBER> : Choose the number of indirect lighting steps to render images faster. 0 to disable indirect lighting.
	--indirect_rays <NUMBER> : Sets the number of indirect rays that will be used to render the image.
	--clamp : Instead of dividing by the greatest color value in the image, all colors will be clamped.
	--gamma : Instead of dividing by the greatest color value in the image, all colors will be gamma corrected and then clamped.
	-s [SCENE_NAME] : Selects the scene to render.

	chess_texture
	cornell

About
-------------
This is the first project of a computer graphics course. As such, it could be used in similar environments which is why this project will be private until and if permission by the faculty is granted.
