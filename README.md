Ray_Tracer
=============
A simple ray tracer and photon mapper that uses Phong's BRDF together with reflectant and refracting materials render 3D scenes using pure C++ with no extra libraries.

Characteristics
------------
The binary `ray_trace` is used as a showcase of some hardcoded scenes. It can handle the following 3D shapes:

* Spheres
* Planes
* Rectangles
* Triangles
* Boxes
* Triangle meshes (loaded from a cutdown version of .obj files)
* Menger Sponges (just for fun)

It can render Lambertian, mirror and refractive surfaces.

As of `v 1.0` there is no support for bitmap textures but to give scenes some artistic sense you can use checker board patterns of any colors and use some experimental features that mess around with surface normals.

Added in this version, you can use tiled textures in .ppm format for axis aligned planes.
Compilation
-------------
To use the basic binary included to render some samples just run from the project directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Usage
-------------
Usage for the binary is as follows.
```
$ ray_trace -h
Usage: ray_trace [OPTION]...
If no options are specified, a default Cornell box with 100000 emitted photons and 500 nearest neighbours will be rendered and saved as cornell.ppm.

The resulting images are clamped by default. If they don't look quite right try --noclamp to divide all colors by the maximum or --gamma to use a 2.2 gamma correction.

Available options:
	-h : Print this helpful text.
	--res <WIDTHxHEIGHT> : Select a different resolution for the result image.
	--clamp : Instead of dividing by the greatest color value in the image, all colors will be clamped.
	--gamma : Instead of dividing by the greatest color value in the image, all colors will be gamma corrected and then clamped.
	-p <INTEGER> : Emits INTEGER photons. The default value is 100,000.
	-k <INTEGER> : When tracing rays search for the INTEGER nearest photons. The default value is 300.
	-s [SCENE_NAME] : Selects the scene to render.

About
-------------
This is the second project of a computer graphics course. As such, it could be used in similar environments which is why this project will be private until and if permission is granted by the faculty.
